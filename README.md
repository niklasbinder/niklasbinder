## Hi there 👋
I am a master's biology student specializing in Computational Biology at the [Institute of Neuropathology](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/neuropathology.html) of the [University of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/). My research focuses on the intricate study of brain tumors, specifically gliomas and meningiomas, using cutting-edge single cell analysis techniques. 
## Single-Cell Omics Analysis Skills

### Languages & Tools
- R: Seurat, Bioconductor (DESeq2, edgeR), tidyverse
- Python: scanpy, anndata, squidpy
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

### Advanced Analysis Techniques
- 🧬 Multiomics Integration
- 🔬 Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
- 🌳 Trajectory Inference & Pseudotime Ordering
- 🧮 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
- 🔍 Cell Type Deconvolution
- 🌐 Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference
- 🧩 Ligand-Receptor Interaction Analysis
- 🔬 Clonal Evolution in Cancer Cells

### Reproducibility
- R Markdown / Jupyter Notebooks
- Containerization (Docker)
