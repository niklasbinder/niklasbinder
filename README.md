## Hi there 👋
I am a master's biology student specializing in Computational Biology at the [Institute of Neuropathology](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/neuropathology.html) of the [University of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/). My research focuses on the intricate study of brain tumors, specifically gliomas and meningiomas, using cutting-edge single cell analysis techniques.
